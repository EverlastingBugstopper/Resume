\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Cloudflare, Inc.}
\descript{| Systems Engineer Intern }
\location{May 2018 – Aug 2018 | Austin, TX}
\vspace{\topsep}
I worked with the Product Strategy team to develop new and exciting applications for the \href{https://cloudflareworkers.com}{Cloudflare Edge Worker product}
\begin{tightemize}
\item I worked closely with Google's AMP and Chrome developers to create the first application that can generate \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses-04}{Signed HTTP Exchanges} on the fly for consumption by Google's AMP Cache. This ongoing project will solve the URL attribution error that plagues Google's AMP project with no effort required from content publishers
\item Developed a lightweight router using ES6 Javascript that can be used to conditionally apply multiple worker scripts and/or render web pages
\item Created a simple, zone-agnostic worker that parses the user agent of every request, and inserts the data into a PostgreSQL database over HTTPS. The same worker charts the browser and operating system data of the site's visitors using chart.js
\item Created a CLI component for \href{https://serverless.com}{serverless.com} using Javascript and the Cloudflare API that allows developers to easily manage custom logic running in a Cloudflare worker
